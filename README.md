5pBP.txt: 5' breakpoints
3G33Nshuman: Output of midpoints from Dong script 3G33N- 
2G33N-human: Output of midpoints from Dong script 2G33N- 
G4hunter: Output of midpoints from G4Hunter by Joao with 3G33N (from email)
```
Sample output:</br>
It seems like G4hunter output has no relation at all with the deletion breakpoint.</br>
Note: setting the deletion frame shift under 100 will cost a significant amout of time for the program to run.

More modification: change arraylist to array, it's over-killing. </br>
Possible new algorithm, reducing time complexity from O((n^2)m) to O(nm).</br>
Update: EVA desktop is even slower.</br>
